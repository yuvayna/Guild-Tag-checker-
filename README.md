﹒ **GuildTag** Bot is an experimental Discord bot designed to interact with Server Tags (also known as Guild Tags), a feature currently in beta testing on Discord. These tags allow members to represent their server with a unique 4-character identifier displayed on their profiles.



## 🚧 Project Status: Alpha 

﹒This project is in its **alpha** stage and is under active development. As such, it may contain bugs or incomplete features. It's intended for developers and testers interested in exploring Discord's Server Tags functionality.



## ⚠️ Limitations

﹒Server Tags are in Beta: Discord's Server Tags feature is currently in beta and available only to select servers. Access is granted randomly and is not guaranteed, even for servers with boosts.

﹒API Restrictions: As of now, Discord's API does not provide endpoints to programmatically access or manage Server Tags. This limitation affects the bot's ability to fully interact with Server Tags.



## 🔧 Planned Features 

﹒Automatic detection of a server's Server Tag.

﹒Slash commands to display and manage Server Tags.

﹒Listing members associated with a specific Server Tag.

﹒Pagination for member lists to enhance readability.
